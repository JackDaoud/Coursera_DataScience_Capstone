# Opening a Gym in Massachussets

## The Problem
Massachusetts' population grew to slightly more than 7 million people last year, enjoying the largest increase of any New England state over the last 10 years at 7.4 percent.<sup>1</sup> That's wonderful growth, however, chronic conditions contribute to 56% of all mortality in Massachusetts and over 53% of all health care expenditures ($30.9 billion a year).<sup>2</sup> Some of these conditions are managable when an individual commits to a healthy regime, which of course involves physical activity. This is based off the fact that physical _inactivity_ is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer of the colon and breast, obesity, hypertension, bone and joint diseases, and depression.<sup>3</sup>

At the moement, 24% of the Massachusetts population (~1.6 million residents) are visiting health clubs - of which there are approximately 1,003.<sup>4</sup> Therefore, there is approximately another 1/2 of the population that suffers from chronic conditions that haven't utilized a health club. Furthermore, health clubs in Massachusetts are currently driving growth of $652 million in revenue and $37.4 million paid in payroll taxes.<sup>4</sup>

## The Solution
Based off the above problem, a reasonable solution would be for social entrepeneurs to open health clubs in potential markets (growing neighborhoods within Massachusetts). Growing neighborhoods are preferred so that the entrepeneurs could achieve a successful business outcome, i.e. make a profit.

To predict market growth, housing price data will be used as a proxy. This is based on the assumption that as the demand for housing increases in a certain neighborhood, then the population of that neighborhood is increasing. Therefore, average home price growth will be used as a primary indicator of potential markets.

Another important factor to consider when opening a business is competition. There are many big franchise gyms that currently exist within Massachusetts, and so when considering a location for a new health club, it would be wise to not set up shop beside a big player. Venue data from Foursquare will be used to help identify competition heavy locations that should be avoided.

## Data
